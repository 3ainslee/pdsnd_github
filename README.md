Bike share data findings

### Description
This project answers 3 questions:
1)Does age influence the type of rider in New York?
2)Does Gender influence the type of rider in New York?
3)Are the males or females in a certain age group?

When you look at the file, you can see the different code used to answer each of the questions.

This code can also be changed to look into the other cities

### Files used
The files used are
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
chicago.csv
I was more curious with New York City than any other city.

The there files are in the .gitignore files
